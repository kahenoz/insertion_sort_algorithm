This Python script demonstrates an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm.

How It Works:
The myFunc function takes an array A as input and sorts it using the Insertion Sort algorithm.

In each iteration of the loop, the current element key is compared with the elements before it (A[0..x-1]).

If an element is greater than key, it is moved one position ahead to make space for the key.

This process continues until the correct position for key is found, and it is inserted into the sorted subarray.

Finally, the sorted array is printed.
